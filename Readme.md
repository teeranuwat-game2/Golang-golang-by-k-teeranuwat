## üìÖ Day One

### Topics Covered

- **Go Install & Run**

- **Basic Go Program Structure**
- **Printing to Console**
- **Functions in Go**
- **Packages**
- **Building a Basic REST API (Native Libraries)**

### üìù Assignments

#### Assignment I: FizzBuzz Program

- Write a function that takes a number as input.
- Use a `for` loop and the function to print the FizzBuzz sequence up to that number.
- Print:
    - `"Fizz"` for multiples of 3
    - `"Buzz"` for multiples of 5
    - `"FizzBuzz"` for multiples of both

#### Assignment II: FizzBuzz with Slice Input

- Write a function that takes a slice of integers as input.
- For each integer, use FizzBuzz logic to print the appropriate value (`"Fizz"`, `"Buzz"`, `"FizzBuzz"`, or the number).
- Reuse the function from Assignment I.

#### Assignment III: Native Libraries REST API

- Build a simple REST API using Go's standard library (`net/http`).
- Implement at least two endpoints (e.g., `GET /ping`, `POST /reverse`).
- Use JSON for request and response bodies.
- Add basic error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Test your endpoints using `curl` or Postman.

#### Assignment IV: Gin REST API

- Create a simple REST API using the Gin framework.
- Implement at least two endpoints (e.g., `GET /hello`, `POST /echo`).
- Use JSON for request and response bodies.
- Add basic error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Test your endpoints using `curl` or Postman.
